# ImageProcessing
This project aims to enhance your proficiency in C++ by focusing on advanced concepts such as pointers, pointer arithmetic, bitwise operators, and the appropriate use of different primitive types. You will implement a program that simulates a simple image processing application, applying various image transformations using these concepts.

## Project Requirements
1. Image Representation:
    - Implement a basic image representation using a custom data structure that stores pixel data. You can use a two-dimensional array or a linear array with appropriate indexing.

2. Input/Output:
    - Design functions to read and write image data from/to files in a common image format (e.g., BMP or PNG). You can use existing libraries for file I/O.

3. Image Processing:
    - Develop a set of image processing functions using pointers and pointer arithmetic, such as:
      1. Image inversion (bitwise NOT).
      2. Image rotation (using pointer arithmetic).
      3. Image blurring (using different primitive types for pixel values).
      4. Image resizing (using pointer arithmetic to interpolate pixel values).
      5. Implement your own grayscale conversion algorithm (using bitwise operators).

4. User Interface (Optional):
    - Create a basic command-line or graphical user interface to allow users to select images, choose transformations, and view the results.

5. Testing:
    - Implement a comprehensive testing framework to validate the correctness of your image processing functions. Test a variety of images and transformations to ensure your program's robustness.

6. Documentation:
    - Write clear and concise documentation, including comments in your code, to explain your implementation and the rationale behind your choices.

7. Performance Optimization (Optional):
    - Explore opportunities to optimize your image processing functions for better performance, considering the trade-offs between speed and memory usage.

## Learning Goals
By completing this project, you will gain proficiency in the following areas:
- Understanding and using pointers for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.
- Performing pointer arithmetic for various data structures, like images.
- Using bitwise operators to manipulate individual bits and binary data.
- Choosing and applying different primitive types for efficient data representation.

## Additional Tips
- Start with simpler transformations and gradually work your way to more complex operations.
- Consider using external libraries like OpenCV for file I/O to focus on the core concepts.
- Seek guidance from C++ resources, forums, and documentation to overcome any challenges you encounter during the project.
